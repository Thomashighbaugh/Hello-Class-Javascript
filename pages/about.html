        <p class="about-body-text">
          I have made a number of sites that incorporate Javascript in some
          capacity, yet have learned Javascript solely on a need-to-know basis
          that has been unstructured and without the feedback circuits inherent
          in a course on the subject. I am hoping to gain a more thorough
          understanding of Javascript than has been gleamed from my many hours
          swearing at my computer or watching tutorials created by well meaning
          but awful Udemy instructors as has thus far been the case.
        </p>
        <h3 class="about-section-title">Prior Experience With Javascript</h3>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          Having made some sites professionally and spent countless hours
          attempting to master the craft in my free time, I do have some
          experience with Javascript, mainly in the form of React. React is a
          framework*** that was produced by Facebook and is behind a lot of
          modern web efforts and is considered a new standard for modern front
          end web development. React has offered me a bridge between HTML5 and
          Javascript due to its reliance on JSX, which is basically HTML in JS.
          React is written in a modular way, like PHP, and separates various
          components of the front end into separate files called
          <em>components</em> that are then called by, and interact with, other
          components to create web applications.

          PC Repairman
        </h3>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          Hardware and Software Repair is my bread and butter. I mostly focus on
          small business clients who need solutions fast and rely on my honest
          reputation for referrals.
        </p>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          Generally I work on Windows machines, which most people use, but am
          thoroughly experienced with Apple and Unix-like systems. I do
          everything from installing new components to provisioning servers for
          small offices. And

        <p class="about-body-text">
          Starting as a service offered to my PC repair customers that has
          expanded into a full blown career pursuit, I spend a lot more of my
          life than I care to admit tinkering with websites and improving
          employable skills for a job in Web Development
          <span class="free"
            >(hint: freelancing isn't what its cracked up to be).</span
          >
        </p>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          I mostly use React, a JS library/framework to develop websites such as
          <a href="https://thomasleonhighbaugh.me">my portfolio site</a>, which
          bridgedthe gap between HTML and JS in m understanding but I hope to
          cultivate a more roobust platform of knowledge with JS which is why I
          am in this class.

        <h3 class="about-section-title">Artist//Photographer</h3>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          In learning about web development, I discovered a certain artistic
          capacity previously undiscovered in myself that has mushroomed into
          its own component of my person over the last few years.
        </p>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          While I focus mainly on making art out of scenery or structures, I
          have dabbled in a variety of subjects. Most of the pieces I make out
          of my photographic efforts is done in a style I call "Neon Noir" which
          contrasts vibrant colors with brooding darkness and a touch of
          mid-century aesthetics.

        <h3 class="about-section-title">Linux Fanatic</h3>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          All of my adventures in tech originate from my switch to Linux as my
          primary Operating System in the early days of Windows 10. Finding that
          OS frustrating, I explored the other options available and since have
          been lost to the ever deepening rabbit hole of the Linux kernel..
        </p>
        <p class="about-body-text">
          At present I run Manjaro Linux with Awesome Window Manager, which I
          have configured completely according to my specific use case and
          taste, which is available with all my other configurations on
          <a href="https://github.com/Thomashighbaugh/dotfiles">Github</a> in
          case anyone finds it useful or wants to see what an opinionated Linux
          configuration looks like.
